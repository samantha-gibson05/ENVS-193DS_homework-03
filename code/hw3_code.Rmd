```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse) # reads in tidyverse package
library(here) # reads in here package
library(janitor) # reads in janitor package
library(readxl) # reads in readxl package

# Stores the salinity data as an object called salinity
salinity <- read.csv(here('data',"salinity-pickleweed.csv")) 

# Stores my personal data as an object called my_data
# my_data <- read.csv() xxx add later xxx

# Problems
## Problem 1. Slough soil salinity
You are working at a restoration site where you are managing planting of California pickleweed (*Salicornia virginica*) along a brackish slough (i.e. there is a mixture of fresh water and salt water).

Be specific in your response to demonstrate your understanding of the variables in this question.

An appropriate parametric test is **Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r)**, which assesses the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two continuous variables (soil salinity (mS/cm) and California pickleweed biomass (g)) assuming approximately normal distributions and independent observations. A non-parametric alternative is **Spearman’s rank correlation ($\rho$)**, which evaluates the strength of a monotonic relationship using ranked values of salinity and biomass and does not require normality. Pearson’s r tests linear association on raw data, whereas Spearman’s $\rho$ tests monotonic association based on ranks and is more flexible to non-normality and outliers.
